ebucore maintenance

The EBUCore specification provides a common set of metadata for describing radio & TV media assets.

EBUCore is widely adopted and requires regular maintenance to address new requirements requested by implementers.

The latest version of the specification is published here: https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3293.pdf.

EBUCore also exists as an ontology https://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/ebucore (documentation) and 
https://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/ebucore.rdf (rdf/xml ontology).
