ebucore maintenance

The EBUCore specification provides a common set of metadata for describing radio & TV media assets.

EBUCore is widely adopted and requires regular maintenance to address new requirements requested by implementers.

Github is used to collaboratively edit the next publishable version of EBUCore.
The latest approved version of the specification is always published here: https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3293.pdf 
with links to the server from where the corresponding schemas can be downloaded.

EBUCore also exists as an ontology https://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/ebucore (documentation) and 
https://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/ebucore.rdf (rdf/xml ontology). The ontology will also be moved 
to github with a new simpler approach for the documentation.

Before doing anything, please read the editing guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.
